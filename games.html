			<p>The app is a cooking and simulation game where players run their own animal-themed restaurant. In the first part of the game the player, you, will have to press a button which hands out the fliers to the population of the community. You will also have to press on the money that the customers will drop. You can also transfer to the different parts of the restaurant in the game. By parts of the restaurant I mean the eating area, kitchen, backyard, and many more. Some places in the game are needed to be unlocked first before transferring to it, the same to the dishes that will be served and the furniture. You will also have animal companions who will work for your restaurant. You can also play mini games in the different places of the place.</p>
